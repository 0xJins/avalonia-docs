# ðŸ‘‰ How To Use Themes

Content in preparation.

## TO DO - Theme resources <a href="#theme-resources" id="theme-resources"></a>

Themes will usually define brushes, colors and other settings as resources. By changing these resources one can e.g. switch from a dark to a light theme. The resources defined will usually be specific to the theme in use but you can see the resources defined by the default theme [here](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/blob/master/src/Avalonia.Themes.Default/Accents/BaseLight.xaml). -> TO DO no you cant!
