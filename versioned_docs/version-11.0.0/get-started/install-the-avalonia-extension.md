# âš¡ Install the Avalonia Extension

To implement applications using _Avalonia UI_, you first need to install the _Avalonia for Visual Studio_ extension.

The extension includes a designer with an XAML pane linked to a UI preview that is capable of updating what you see, as you write XAML. The extension also installs all the library files you need, provides Intellisense, and adds some solution templates.

Follow this procedure to install the _Avalonia for Visual Studio_ extension:

* [ ] In Visual Studio click **Manage Extensions** on the**Extensions** top menu.
* [ ] In the **Search** box, type 'Avalonia'.;
* [ ] Click **Download** and follow the instructions (you will need to close Visual Studio while the VSIX installation runs).
