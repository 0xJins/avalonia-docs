# How To Build and Run on the iOS Simulator

Please ensure you have followed the guide [create-a-cross-platform-solution.md](../create-a-cross-platform-solution.md "mention").

Assuming you have created a project called `HelloWord`. Enter the directory `HelloWorld.iOS` from the command line.

To build the project for iOS run the following command.

```bash
dotnet build
```

To run the project in a simulator, run the following command.

```bash
dotnet run
```

If you use `JetBrains Rider` or `Visual Studio for Mac` you can open the solution and run, build and debug your program inside the simulator.
